# Hydrogen Redirect Theme

[Download](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen-redirect-theme/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

When launching a Hydrogen storefront, youâ€™ll likely also want to redirect
any traffic that happens to hit your Liquid store too. This theme allows you
helps you do that while also making sure you retain features like the bot
detection checkpoint, and discount links.

## Setup

1. [Download the theme](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen-redirect-theme/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Navigate to **Online Store -> Themes** in your Shopify admin
3. **Upload** the theme to your Theme Library
4. **Customize** the Redirect theme
5. Go to **Theme settings -> Storefront** and configure `storefront_hostname`
6. **Publish** the theme

## Custom redirects

You can configure the `custom_redirects` value in **Theme settings > Storefront**.

The redirect rule format is as following:

```
Shopify path > Storefront path
```

Each line in the textarea represents a single redirect rule.

### Example configuration

The example below removes the `/account` prefix from the login, register and reset password redirects.

```
/account/login > /login
/account/register > /register
/account/reset > /reset-password
/account/activate > /activate-account
```

## Gift cards

Since the Shopify Storefront API does not yet support fetching gift cards, a customizable `gift_card.liquid` template has been added.

## Checkpoint template for Bot Protection
